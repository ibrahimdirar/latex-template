  abstract  = {Client/server application development is becoming increasingly popular in commercial organizations. However, previous research has found that current application development methodologies provide little or no support for client/server computing possibly due to the relative newness of the technology in commercial environments. This research is the first step in demonstrating the applicability of the client/server methodology enhancements proposed in a commercial Management Information System (MIS) environment. It examines the application of traditional development methodologies to the client/server environment, the problems associated in using these methodologies and the respondent's rating of the importance of the various client/server application development issues included in the proposed methodology.},
