Consult \textbf{your supervisor} to check the content of the introduction chapter. In this template, we only offer basic sections of an introduction chapter. It may  not be complete and comprehensive. Writing a report is a subjective matter, and a report's style and structure depend on the ``type of project'' as well as an individual's preference. This template suits the following project paradigms:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item software engineering and software/web application development;
    \item algorithm implementation, analysis and/or application;
    \item science lab (experiment); and
    \item pure theoretical development (not mention extensively).
\end{enumerate}
